Math says there's a 12 hour difference. My heart says you're right here. It's weird walking through streets you haven't seen, living a day you haven't started yet. But then my phone lights up, and the distance disappears.
I don’t think you even realize how rare you are. The way you care. The way you notice small things. The way you show up. The way you're quite literally the best friend, girlfriend and daughter anyone could ask for. You're the most bubbly, most beautiful, most kindest, most caring, most lovable person I've ever met.You’ve grown so much, and it’s been beautiful to witness. I’m so proud of you for staying so strong. On your birthday, I don’t just celebrate the day you were born.
I celebrate the day the world got someone like you.
There’s a warmth about you that feels like home. A steadiness that makes chaos feel manageable. No matter how shit life goes, I know I'll always have you.
I’m lucky to know you.
Happy Birthday to someone who makes life gentler just by being in it. 🤍
