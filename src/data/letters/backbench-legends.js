You’ve shaped my days in ways you probably don’t even realize. The way you listen. The way you understand without me having to explain every detail. The way I never feel like I have to perform or pretend around you.

With you, I just am.

I really wish I could be there next to you right now and watch you blow the candles on your cake. 

I hope you have a wonderful year tanu. You’re the strongest person I know and I know you’ll do amazing this year. I hope this year gives you clarity when you’re confused, peace when you’re overwhelmed, courage when you’re scared, and a shit load of happiness. You are capable of so much more than you see. Don’t shrink yourself. Don’t doubt your worth. Everything will work out in your favour. Just trust yourself and stay happy my cookie and cream boba.
Happy 18th birthday kiddo.
I love you. More than I probably say. More than you probably know.`
