And then I found you: my missing puzzle piece.
You’re more than I could ever ask for. You really are my prayers answered. I am so grateful for you Tanu. You’re such a good friend and an even more amazing human.
You’re like a bundle of sunshine that rolled into my life one day (5th june 2020 to be specific) and it’s been illuminating my life ever since. Through the random days, the hard days, the everything-in-between days, you’ve been constant.
You are my best friend. And I love you more than words will ever fully capture.`
